# Phonology

## Phonemic Inventory

Below are shown all consonants in Creeve, phonemes with parentheses indicate allophones.

| *Consonants* | labial | coronal | palatal | velar |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| nasal| `m` | `n` | | |
| plosive | `(p) b` | | `t d` | | |
| affricates | | `ts` | | |
| continuant s | | `s z` | | |
| continuant -s | `B w` | `f` | `T D` | `J j` | `x G` |
| rhotic | | `r 4` | | |
| lateral | | `l` | | |

Creeve phones tends to interact with each other through a dynamic and complex manner, thus there are some allophony and sound changes found. Special rules govern phones to fuse or integrate.

The alveolar consonants, which populate most of the inventory, is pronounced mostly laminal or denti-alveolar. Exceptions for liquids are pronounced apical. Continuants `/T D/` is pronounced rather non-sibilant and not interdental and become `/_ds _dz/` respectively. Voiceless alveolar plosive never exist as coda and all polsive always unaspirated. In addition, palatal consonants `/J j/` tend to shift to prepalatal. Also, velar consonants are slightly fronted.

The fricatives `/f J/` are always have more friction than the rest. The rhotic `/r/` is a trill, but can be lenited as flapped `/4/`, especially when positioned as intervocalic consonant.

Nasal consonants /m n/ are often interact with precedent phones. Nasals often exist as relative as coda, meaning that the manner of pronounciation often doesn't change much comparing with their onset. Nasals can be found short /m n/ or long as /m: n:/. While short nasal can be found as onset and coda, long nasal can only happen as coda and often leave an archiphoneme vowel as the result of gemination of consonant.

While /m/ is purely realized as voiced bilabial nasal, /n/, as most of coronal phonemes, can be realized as laminar denti-alveolar or laminal alveolar. The allophony occurs often caused by assimilation, often if nasals are intervocalic, meaning the position of coronal depends on where the precedent vowel occurs.
