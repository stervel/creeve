Below are shown all consonants in Creeve, phonemes with parentheses indicate allophones.

Creeve phones tends to interact with each other through a dynamic and complex manner, thus there are some allophony and sound changes found. Special rules govern phones to fuse or integrate. Described below on how consonants change and interact with other sounds.

## Nasal sounds /m n/
Nasals are often interact with precedent phones. Nasals often exist as relative as coda, meaning that the manner of pronounciation often doesn't change much comparing with their onset. Nasals can be found short /m n/ or long as /m: n:/. While short nasal can be found as onset and coda, long nasal can only happen as coda and often leave an archiphoneme vowel as the result of gemination of consonant.

        verzan  BErzAn      blaze, wildfire
        alnè    HAln\ae     thought
        šonnè   JUn:a       beverage        šon-n

While /m/ is purely realized as voiced bilabial nasal, /n/, as most of coronal phonemes, can be realized as laminar denti-alveolar , laminal alveolar, or apical alveolar. The allophony occurs often caused by assimilation, often if nasals are intervocalic. Meaning the position of coronal depends on where the precedent vowel occurs.
