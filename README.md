# Creeve documentation

This repo contains most of thing I made about Creeve project, an a priori constructed language. After tedious sorting of workflow (and yet still not fully great at all) I decided to give git a try, which helps me to keeps logs and version history as opposed with the traditional way of making local history-thing.

The documentation is still in moving phase. Since I'm not quite familiar with git yet, all things may be slow and cluttered here and there.

Also, this repo is by no means of formal documentation at all, instead it's kind of a dump of notes and dense description of mine. Since I'm in the process of moving and familiarizing with github environment, there might be a large portion of documentation that missing or wrong.
